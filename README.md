# üöÄ AWS Infrastructure with Terraform ‚Äî VPC, ALB, EC2, and Security Groups

This project provisions a complete AWS infrastructure using Terraform.
It includes a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with public, private, and database subnets, an Application Load Balancer (ALB), EC2 instances, and properly configured Security Groups.
This setup is designed to simulate a real-world environment for deploying web applications with load balancing and network segmentation.

## üß± Project Architecture

The infrastructure includes:

- VPC
Public, Private, and Database subnets across multiple Availability Zones.
NAT Gateway for outbound internet access from private subnets.
DNS support and hostname resolution enabled.

- Security Groups
Bastion SG (Public access via SSH)
Private SG (Access limited to VPC CIDR)
Load Balancer SG (HTTP access from internet)

- EC2 Instances
Public instance (bastion host)
Private instances (application servers) created via loop\
- Elastic IP
Allocated to the public bastion host

- Application Load Balancer
HTTP listener on port 80
Health check path /app1/index.html
Targets EC2 instances in private subnets

## üß† Key Learnings from This Project
- How to use Terraform modules to create reusable and clean infrastructure code.
- Building a highly available network using VPC and subnets.
- Configuring security groups to control traffic at multiple layers.
- Attaching EC2 instances to an Application Load Balancer.
- Using Elastic IPs for stable public access.
